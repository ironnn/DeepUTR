# DeepUTR

DeepUTR is a model designed to predict the translation efficiency (TE) of human 5' UTRs. This model aims to analyze the 5' UTR sequences to predict their regulatory capacity on translation.

## Project Description

This project provides a deep learning-based approach to predict the translation efficiency (TE) of human mRNA 5' UTR regions. The model leverages the structural and sequence features of 5' UTRs, combined with multiple biological data sources, to predict translation regulation potential.

## Train and inference

- **Model Training**: Train the model using `train.py`.
- **Inference and Prediction**: Perform inference and TE prediction using `model_inference.py`.

## Installation
